# Information
The purpose of this website is to create a platform for instructors to teach self-made courses to students through a distance-learning format.  Instructors create courses with curriculums and assignments, and students can search for and sign up for those courses and learn from assigned readings, videos, or any other medium chosen by the professor.  They can submit assignments to be graded.  Professors have access to student rosters for each of their courses.
There will be two types of accounts for students and instructors.  There will be a common header on every page with an icon that links back to the home page, and links to take the user to other pages.  Instructors can create multiple courses and assign multiple instructors to each, and can accept or deny students who choose to enroll in their courses.  
The contributors are Daniel Yoh and Minjae Kim.

### D0
I learned how to create basic schematics for a website.  A wireframe is essentially simple blueprints that provide visual representations for a site and its pages and functions, with labels for quickly explaining various modules.  I also learned that a sitemap is a map of all pages for a website, showing their relationships to convey how to get from one page to another.  Usually, the home page is the first page that gets worked on when planning a website.  The layout of a page should fit the page's function, but there should be some consistency in all pages, such as a common header, color scheme, and/or overall vibe.  These blueprints should be able to show the basic ideas of a site's structure and its pages, and their general purposes.  I should also be sure that the wireframes account for small screen sizes like mobile devices.  Overall, I learned how to create a wireframe and a sitemap to create a website.  
I created the GitHub repo, drew the sitemap, edit course, course, assignment, create assignment, and admin pages, and put together most of the readme for D0.

### D1
For D1, I put together the HTML for the pages I created.

### D0
I came to realization that planning out your website via wireframing and sitemapping is an important step in creating a website. Before when i learned about wireframing and sitemapping, I was just doing my own projects in very unorganized way. I would have a very basic idea of what I want the website to look like and just tackle it head on. Throught this assignment, I have leanred wireframe is a draft for a website that represents the overall function and design while sitemap is list of pages that makes up the website. I found wiremapping to be very useful since it does give an overall layout.
In this project, I drew and designed homepage, sign-up, search, create course and student roster.

### D1
Creating an HTML complete design and layout of our website for D0 was definitely more straight forward and convenient for me to take reference and follow. Through this assignment, I have leanred the important of having a design structure to follow instead of just coding on top of my head. It feels like of like following a rough draft
when writing an essay. I would say writing the HTML code was much easier than actually trying to design the website because all I had to really do is follow the layout.
For this assignment, I created the pages for student roster, create course, edit course, selected course, admin view, and accept/reject page.
